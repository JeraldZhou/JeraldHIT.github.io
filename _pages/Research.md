### <span id = "anchor">Intelligent Algorithm Applied for Microwave Sensor Design 2019.08 - 2020.06</span>
 * Supervisor: Cong Wang Professor Institute: Advanced Material and Nanotechnology Lab, HIT
    * Designed a novel high-quality factor optimized microwave resonator with programmable defective ground structure (DGS) based on Adaptive Genetic Algorithm (AGA).
    * Combined conventional Couple Split-Square Resonator (CSRR) with DGS to obtain maximum Q-factor and ultra-high sensitivity.
    * Applied AGA to achieve faster convergence with fewer iterations compared with conventional genetic algorithm.
    * Obtained a high sensitivity microwave thickness sensor which could be used in micron-sized instrument measurement.
    * A paper has been submitted and is currently under review (as shown in PUBLICATIONS 3).

### <span id = "anchor">Performance-Enhanced Vertical LED Using Laser Irradiation Treatment to Control Wafer-Level N-Gan Protrusion Arrays 2019.08 - 2020.04</span>
 * Supervisor: Cong Wang Professor Institute: Advanced Material and Nanotechnology Lab, HIT
   * Proposed a controllable, mask-free, and wafer-level surface texturing method, which is applied to n-GaN protrusion array using laser irradiation treatment targeting to achieve high-performance vertical light-emitting diodes.
   * Modified a portion of the n-GaN epitaxial film with optimized laser irradiation conditions to generate an appropriate morphological structure to get high-performance LEDs.
   * Explored the impact of laser lift-off(LLO) on high output power of Vertical LED and analyzed the in-depth mechanism.
   * Set multiple controlled process conditions of peeling the n-GaN from the epitaxial lm by irradiation to get optimum parameters.
   * Increased the light output power up to 47.8% at an injection current of 350 mA compared with the conventional vertical LED and reached the standards of industrial grade which could be expected to save costs in mass production.
   * A paper has been published (as shown in PUBLICATIONS 1).

Laser scanning has been widely used in the industrial manufacturing, especially in reverse engineering, quality control and surface defect detection. Achieving automatic scanning can succeed in reducing production costs and increasing production efficiency. In our project, we proposed an automatic intelligent scanning system based on ROS, including robot arm, RGBD camera and line laser scanner.

### <span id = "anchor3">Intelligent operation of robot arm</span>
* Advisor: Huijun Gao , IEEE Fellow and Professor of Department of Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology
  * Employed the linear-quadratic-Gaussian regulator (LQG) to make the UR10 robot arm move to a designated position.
  * Modified the guided policy search method (a policy search method in reinforcement learning) in executing simulated robotic manipulation tasks.
  * Used position control with guided policy search method to train the UR10 robot arm move to a designatedposition without using inverse kinematics
